  title: About Me
  description: As a qualified and registered professional, I bring the benefit of
    my 30+ years of Speech-Language Pathology experience to meeting a client's
    communication needs. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Communicative Disorders
    and a Master of Arts in Speech Pathology. In addition, I have maintained my
    Certification of Clinical Competence with the American
    Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and am registered with the
    College of Speech and Hearing Professionals of British Columbia (CSHPBC).
    This has granted me with numerous opportunities in my role as the Clinical
    Educator/Supervisor for many SLP students completing their Masters' degrees.

  heading: My Goals
  description: >
    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
